Erlang postgres driver
======================

This driver is the same you know from the [jungerl](http://jungerl.sf.net) repository.

A google group [mailing list for erlang pgsql](http://groups.google.com/group/erlang-pgsql-patches) 
has been set up for the project. There is also the #erlang channel on irc.freenode.net.
